# SIR_TP6
## JHipster = AngularJS + JPA + SpringBoot

### Application by [LAGADEC Quentin](https://github.com/quentin29200) et [GIGOU Nicolas](https://github.com/gigouni)
Application joining the result of two labs during the SIR. This is the connection between a FRONT AngularJS (Javascript) and BACK with JPA (Java) around an electronic devices manager.

The aim of this lab is to create an user interface which use at least one reading service (GET request) and one writing service (POST/PUT/PATCH request) based on a [previous JPA project](https://github.com/quentin29200/SR1_testjpa). So this step will be divided in two sub-steps, the FRONT-END part in one hand and the BACK-END in the other hand.

To be more efficient and use the tools seen during courses, we've used JHipster. Why ? Because JHipster is an Yeoman generator (like AngularJS generator). The database is based on the JPA principles and there is a separation between our user interface and our services application. More over, it's using SpringBoot and Swagger. This last one provides a REST API.

We've followed the next model to build our project : 

![model](https://github.com/gigouni/SIR_TP6_DeviceManager-JHipster/blob/master/sir_tp6_jhipster_model.png?raw=true"The model of the application")

**The following lines are automatically generated by JHipster. It's kind of usefull so we're thinking that it's a good support here.**

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g gulp

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    gulp

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.


## Building for production

To optimize the sir_tp6 client for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Testing

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript/` and can be run with:

    gulp test
